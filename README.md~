# py_lite.js

The idea behind py_lite is to implement some useful Python functionality. If you are familiar with the Python style of doing something, using the same paradigm can help with productivity

###Getting Started

Include py_lite.js and lodash.js (underscore should be plug compatible with lodash.js but this has not been tested). The dependency is very small and the only function used is _.isEqual(x,y) to check the equivalence of two objects.
